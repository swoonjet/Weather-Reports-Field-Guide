<p>Change in pressure</p>
<p>his ears start ringing the moment he turns down the fire lane to Naganash Lake</p>
<p>Ears plugged, like breathing inside a jar</p>
<p>Must be a low front coming in</p>
<br>
<p>He opens his jaw</p>
<p>pops it</p>
<p>doesn’t work</p>
<br>
<p>Sky overhead, low, and fast</p>
<p>Hard not to look</p>
<p>—keep the eyes on the pavement—</p>
<p>But the clouds are good</p>
<p>They work like a brim</p>
<br>
<p>Blinker still going</p>
<p>One, two, three, four</p>
<p>Let it tick</p>
<p>no one else on the road</p>
<p>He pulls up on the lawn to the cabin, like they always did</p>
<br>
<p>His sister Sally said: Take whatever you want</p>
<p><em>Actually</em>, she said, <em>you could live there</em></p>
<p><em>at the cabin instead</em></p>
<p><em>like Grandpa did</em></p>
<p>She just knows he never liked the other house</p>
<p>the one he’s fighting so hard for</p>
<p>hates it</p>
<p>Plaster non-load-bearing pillars</p>
<p>Tweed carpet smelling like plastic</p>
<br>
<p>Worked his whole life to pay for it</p>
<p>He looks down at that stump of a left thumb</p>
<p>gave a whole half a thumb for it too</p>
<br>
<p>Told Sally he’ll fix what needs fixing</p>
<p>Didn’t answer about the house</p>
<br>
<p>but</p>
<br>
<p>First to the boathouse, grab the camp chair</p>
<p>The smells hit him</p>
<p>he knows them so well</p>
<p>like they’ve been in him all along</p>
<p>gasoline</p>
<p>wet metal</p>
<p>fermenting leaves</p>
<br>
<p>Grandpa’s barometers still hanging on nails</p>
<p>He taps the glass of each</p>
<p>One, two, three, four</p>
<p>Needles jitter</p>
<p>Storm/Fair/Falling</p>
<p>Taps them again</p>
<p>Satisfying sound on the glass</p>
<br>
<p>Kids’ life jackets</p>
<p>squirrel-nutted</p>
<p>black-mildewed, webbed</p>
<br>
<p>Kids haven’t been there for a decade</p>
<p>Haven’t been to the house much either</p>
<br>
<p>Kids are Jenny’s thing</p>
<p>he stays on the side</p>
<br>
<p>Now those three empty bedrooms</p>
<p>Nights with too much whiskey</p>
<p>laying in those bunk beds not remembering or thinking</p>
<p>just laying there</p>
<br>
<p>He clicks the knob on Grandpa’s transistor</p>
<p>Still works</p>
<p>"Boys of Summer"</p>
<p>He never liked that song</p>
<p>always made a place in his chest go small</p>
<p><em>I should just let 'em go, but…</em></p>
<p>Song cuts out</p>
<p>Emergency chord</p>
<p>tinny and layered</p>
<p>“This is the National Weather Service…</p>
<p>irregular atmospheric behavior…</p>
<p>researchers at the Midwestern Atmospheric Lab expect…”</p>
<p>He clicks it off</p>
<p>Rather not know</p>
<br>
<p>Walking down to the shore</p>
<p>dull footfalls in his head</p>
<p>hearing his breathing too loud</p>
<br>
<p>The dock’s boards are sagging</p>
<p>Nails sticking out</p>
<p>Bits of foam floating in the shallows</p>
<p>Means something’s nesting in there</p>
<p>Sally didn’t bring the dock in last winter</p>
<p>Said</p>
<p><em>we’re selling</em></p>
<br>
<p>The clouds are still moving fast</p>
<br>
<p>He sits</p>
<p>camp chair tilted on uneven boards</p>
<p>Take advantage of the cloud cover</p>
<p>fast-moving gray on gray</p>
<p>The lake surface is agitated can’t see through it</p>
<p>Ripples cross, directionless</p>
<p>Soft, slow rain</p>
<p>Dropping black dots on the surface</p>
<p>Count the ripples as they thin</p>
<p>One, two, three, four</p>
<br>
<p>Then his ears pop</p>
<p>the sound, same ringing,</p>
<p>a bell that doesn’t stop</p>
<p>But outside his head now</p>
<br>
<p>Like he’s stepped into a much larger room</p>
<p>The sound is out on the lake now</p>
<br>
<p>He heaves himself out of the chair mumbling to himself</p>
<p><em>Better check the damage</em></p>
<br>
<p>Cloudy morning</p>
<p>Time to rake</p>
<p>same one Grandpa used</p>
<p>duct tape around the handle</p>
<p>bent tooth on the end</p>
<p>Twelve strokes</p>
<br>
<p>Pause</p>
<p>Twelve more</p>
<p>Water clear today</p>
<p>Can see the shifting weeds</p>
<p>whole mat of milfoil rising and falling, slow</p>
<p>He rakes again</p>
<p>Foam comes up with it</p>
<p>Bits of dock chewed to pulp</p>
<br>
<p>Muskrats</p>
<br>
<p>Twelve more rakes</p>
<p>He stops</p>
<p>leans on the rake</p>
<p>looks out</p>
<p>Fast clouds, still no sky</p>
<p>Good</p>
<br>
<p>A bluegill hovers near the surface</p>
<p>half-shadowed under a spill of algae</p>
<p>like it’s using it for an umbrella</p>
<p>Just hanging there</p>
<p>Not twitching, not darting</p>
<br>
<p>Then floating near it</p>
<p>like a bit of paint spill on the surface,</p>
<p>a fleck of green blue</p>
<br>
<p>But then it starts shifting</p>
<p>It isn’t floating</p>
<p>It’s a reflection</p>
<br>
<p>That damn thing in the sky whatever the hell it is</p>
<p>Puts his fishing hat on</p>
<p>Brim down</p>
<p>Sky out of sight</p>
<br>
<p>Back to the rake</p>
<p>but the reflection, the oil-spill slow movement of it</p>
<p>Is the sound louder?</p>
<br>
<p>Turns away from the mirrored lake</p>
<p>gets down on his knees</p>
<p>water up to his shoulders</p>
<p>weeds tangling all around him</p>
<p>Reaching under the dock foam gone soft with chewing holes</p>
<p>in the bank</p>
<p>bedding packed tight with leaves</p>
<p>Sawdust-chewed foam tucked in</p>
<br>
<p>Tiny kit teeth markings</p>
<p>How many babies will there be?</p>
<p>He holds still</p>
<p>listens</p>
<p>Soft squeaks or movement</p>
<p>barely audible</p>
<p>like wind in a can</p>
<br>
<p>Could just be the ringing</p>
<p>Not sure</p>
<br>
<p>Back to the boathouse</p>
<p>Going to need traps</p>
<p>humane ones</p>
<p>had a couple back in the day</p>
<p>Might need more</p>
<br>
<p>That night: the dream</p>
<p>Slashing open the elk, clean deliberate</p>
<p>Its hide peels like wet paper steaming</p>
<p>But when it falls into his arms he doesn't let go</p>
<p>He cradles its head, presses his face to its neck</p>
<p>sobs racking</p>
<p>He meets her eyes</p>
<p>Dark liquid</p>
<p>Like looking into something with no bottom</p>
<br>
<p>He tries to scrape the organs back in</p>
<p>Says <em>I’m sorry</em> again and again</p>
<p>His father and grandfather stand there</p>
<p>Proud?</p>
<br>
<p>The organs spill out anyway</p>
<p>but there’s no blood</p>
<p>No guts</p>
<p>Color like oil, slow and curling</p>
<p>Then he looks down and sees the blade</p>
<p>has opened him too</p>
<p>and what spills from him is</p>
<br>
<p>lake water</p>
<p>choked with weeds</p>
<br>
<p>He wakes in the night</p>
<p>The sound like it’s inside the walls now</p>
<p>One trap sprung</p>
<p>a kit inside shivering</p>
<br>
<p>Takes it up onto the shore</p>
<p>Leaves it there in the trap</p>
<p>Says, <em>I'll deal with it in the morning</em></p>
<p>When morning comes the trap is empty</p>
<br>
<p>Morning steam rises from the burrow hole like breath</p>
<p>Mud damp</p>
<p>warm, alive</p>
<br>
<p>Gray reflects gray</p>
<p>Perfect glass surface</p>
<p>Thinks about taking out the boat</p>
<p>he used to live for that</p>
<p>Going fishing, the tackle</p>
<p>the hush of it getting away</p>
<p>Now what’s the point</p>
<br>
<p>Never could kill anything anyway</p>
<p>just tear open their mouths</p>
<p>and let them drift out to die</p>
<br>
<p>The trap being empty irritates him</p>
<p>feels personal</p>
<p>Then he sees her</p>
<p>Muskrat mother, just out there riding the water</p>
<p>her snake grace</p>
<p>the matted curls of her wet oiled coat</p>
<p>dark liquid and knowing</p>
<p>She rolls smooth as rope and vanishes</p>
<br>
<p>He sets out to smoke the nest</p>
<p>Builds the fire from scraps</p>
<p>half-rotted pine oil-stained cardboard mildewed newspaper</p>
<p>Gets a good burn going</p>
<p>Shoves it under the dock</p>
<br>
<p>Smoke curls thick and gray</p>
<p>blows back at him</p>
<p>Gets in his eyes</p>
<p>His chest chokes him</p>
<br>
<p>thick sour wood-tar heat</p>
<p>His temples throb</p>
<p>mouth dry</p>
<p>Reminds him of Grandpa's pipes</p>
<p>the factory forge</p>
<p>His thumb throbs</p>
<p>always aches in the heat</p>
<p>His mind starts filling with pictures he doesn’t want:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <br>
    <p>Monopoly on the living room floor</p>
    <p>yellow butter-soaked popcorn</p>
    <p>Where is <em>he</em>?</p>
    <p>Another: his father</p>
    <p><em>No point you even having that</em></p>
    <p>Taking the hunting rifle from his hands</p>
    <p>Then:</p>
    <p>Grandpa snatching the fish hanging</p>
    <p>face splotchy</p>
    <p><em>You could've been a nature man</em></p>
    <p><em>A real man</em></p>
    <p><em>But…</em></p>
    <p>His brother shaking his head almost smiling</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He grabs a warped board, starts pulling</p>
<p>Til its nails break free</p>
<p>He rips up another</p>
<p>then another</p>
<br>
<p>Finds that nest, digs it all out with his hand</p>
<br>
<p>Nothing</p>
<br>
<p>But there she is again, watching in the water</p>
<p>weaving back and forth</p>
<p>taunting him, is she showing him her teeth?</p>
<p><em>Go ahead</em></p>
<p>she seems to be saying</p>
<p><em>go ahead try, I am right here</em></p>
<br>
<p>There must be another nest</p>
<p>Early sky dull, swirling, faint</p>
<br>
<p>He keeps his eyes on the water</p>
<br>
<p>The lake surface is that tight skin of glass</p>
<p>cold and stretched</p>
<br>
<p>Then</p>
<p>She breaks it</p>
<p>Her head first</p>
<p>then her back</p>
<p>Then two, three, four smaller humps behind her</p>
<p>She’s out there with them</p>
<p>clear as anything</p>
<p>Not even hiding</p>
<br>
<p>Just out there</p>
<br>
<p>Smooth and proud</p>
<br>
<p>And he is in the water</p>
<p>before he knows it</p>
<p>Boots sloshing</p>
<p>jeans gone heavy</p>
<p>arms swinging like he can reach them</p>
<br>
<p>She sees him</p>
<p>Lifts her head, turns</p>
<p>and is gone</p>
<br>
<p>He keeps going</p>
<p>water up to his ribs</p>
<p>breath in his ears</p>
<p>Heart punching</p>
<br>
<p>Then nothing</p>
<p>He staggers back to the dock</p>
<p>Lies down hard</p>
<p>a board cuts under the ridge of his shoulder blade</p>
<p>Stays there anyway</p>
<p>Sky turning above</p>
<br>
<p>Doesn’t look up</p>
<br>
<p>Still damp</p>
<p>hands shaking a little</p>
<p>He sits up</p>
<p>The dock is warming in the morning sun</p>
<p>He looks out over the lake once</p>
<p>Then down at the deck</p>
<br>
<p>Starts pulling</p>
<p>First a board at the edge</p>
<p>then another</p>
<p>Doesn’t even go back for tools</p>
<p>just kicks, pulls, wrenches</p>
<p>Rusty nails tear loose with a groan</p>
<p>Old splinters in his palms</p>
<br>
<p>Feels good</p>
<br>
<p>Works his way in</p>
<p>tearing up the surface</p>
<p>Foam underneath</p>
<p>eaten through in spots</p>
<br>
<p>Then</p>
<p>there it is</p>
<p>another hole</p>
<p>wider than the others</p>
<p>darker</p>
<p>He crouches low</p>
<br>
<p>Can smell it</p>
<p>Warm earth</p>
<p>nest smell</p>
<p>He’ll come back tonight</p>
<br>
<p>Gloves, gag, rocks</p>
<p>He’ll go quiet this time</p>
<p>won’t leave empty-handed</p>
<p>Wait for the night</p>
<br>
<p>Even in the house he thinks he can hear them</p>
<p>The high ringing and now underneath it a new sound</p>
<p>little rustlings</p>
<p>nuzzlings</p>
<br>
<p>Night comes</p>
<p>Clearer than it’s been in days</p>
<p>Still no stars</p>
<p>The ringing is there</p>
<p>steady</p>
<p>thinned out</p>
<p>stretched</p>
<br>
<p>Can’t tell if it’s in his ears or out there</p>
<br>
<p>He comes out with the gloves</p>
<p>Canvas duffel he found in the boathouse</p>
<p>Fills the bottom with rocks</p>
<p>Big ones</p>
<p>Fist-size</p>
<br>
<p>Doesn’t turn on a light</p>
<p>Doesn’t need one</p>
<br>
<p>The dock is stripped</p>
<p>The last hole yawning wide</p>
<p>He gets down</p>
<p>on his side</p>
<br>
<p>Elbows in the muck</p>
<p>reaches in slow</p>
<p>Can smell the nest again</p>
<p>wet fur</p>
<p>mold, warmth</p>
<p>Then movement</p>
<p>a tiny one</p>
<p>Then another</p>
<p>soft bodies brushing his knuckles</p>
<p>He grabs two, three, four</p>
<p>five, six, seven</p>
<br>
<p>Stuffs them in the bag</p>
<p>Zips it</p>
<p>Bag moves in his hands</p>
<br>
<p>He holds it away from his chest</p>
<p>Brings it down to the water</p>
<p>Stands there</p>
<p>bare feet in the muck</p>
<br>
<p>Lake like slate</p>
<p>Colors turning pale around the edges</p>
<p>Like dawn but wrong</p>
<br>
<p>He can’t throw yet</p>
<br>
<p>The bag jerks once</p>
<p>He grips it tighter</p>
<br>
<p>Sits down in the chair</p>
<p>Arms wrapped around it</p>
<p>the small animals twist against him</p>
<br>
<p>Closes his eyes</p>
<p>He’ll get up the nerve</p>
<p>He will</p>
<br>
<p>Limbs heavy</p>
<p><em>I’ll just doze off a second</em></p>
<p><em>then do it</em></p>
<p>Their little bodies calming against his chest</p>
<p>He awakes to the sound</p>
<p>Tornado siren</p>
<br>
<p>Light floods his eyelids</p>
<p>blinding at first</p>
<br>
<p>Then the colors</p>
<br>
<p>The lake flashes silver</p>
<p>The sky too loud to look at</p>
<br>
<p>He looks anyway</p>
<br>
<p>The sound isn’t just the ringing anymore</p>
<p>it’s layered</p>
<p>bells sirens cicadas</p>
<p>like all nature screaming</p>
<p>The sky electric blues hot pinks</p>
<p>Oil-slicked and swirling</p>
<p>Too bright too close</p>
<p>The colors come down</p>
<p>The noise builds</p>
<br>
<p>Both distant and as near as lips against his cheek</p>
<p>It’s beautiful</p>
<p>Blinding</p>
<p>Too much</p>
<br>
<p>Coming for him</p>
<br>
<p>Heat in his face</p>
<p>cold tears</p>
<p>Hadn’t noticed them til then.</p>
<p>The bag twitches again</p>
<p>Something moves in him too</p>
<p>A flicker low in his chest</p>
<br>
<p>He stands, swings</p>
<p>Lets it go</p>
<p>It slaps the water flat</p>
<p>then disappears</p>
<p>trailing no ripple</p>
<br>
<p>Only the sky</p>
<br>
<p>Still turning</p>
<p>And he stands</p>
<p>taking it in</p>
<br>
<p>The sound moves through him now</p>
<br>
<p>like he is water</p>
<br>
<p>Just water</p>
<br>
<p>No resistance now</p>
