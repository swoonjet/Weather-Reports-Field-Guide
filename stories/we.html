    <p>iT’S WHAT we’ve been predicting, i, rather we said, this change, isn’t it? Almost 20 years now, and we’ve been waiting for this. We hear the blackbirds tap, tap, tapping on our third floor gutters. They didn’t do that before? RIGHT? Right. There is no on this roof except us, living here in me and my body, but it was easier that way -- Had to make a living, didn’t we? Worked for the worse sort of people, those bankers, those hedge fundies, those mortgage brokers -- even a stint on the FLOOR, the high functioning polydrug abusing stockbrokers and their support staff</p>
<p>Services. Couldn’t be yelling about the Anthropocene and how those investments would kill the planet, could we? And the magician we knew, raised by The 7 Year Chastisement?</p>
<p>When he died, someone had to take his world view, his POV to make it alive! O O I’m smelling the perfume, they must approve, otherwise we’d taste the iron and blood -- We don’t know if that means disapproval, but I don’t want to know the One who approves of our secret sacred life stuff externalized!</p>
<p>They’re all sleeping, aren’t they? Why? How? Those pillars are rising, already there are less stars, before morning, this time, we’ll hear them sing!</p>
<p>No it hasn’t happened yet, but the I, which was the magus talks about the ‘Great Disappointment’ And how the church fathers predicted the end, and it failed to come, but it wasn’t a lie or a con, it was A DISAPPOINTMENT, and yes, yes we hear you, that’s how we lived for 17 years, but what’s happened this year, along with all the social unrest, whatever it is, all that energy we</p>
<p>Poured into the sky, is finally calling up something BIG and REAL and not at all what we expected. YES, I’ve inherited a bit of End-Times thinking, but no one is coming to save us! We did this and we deserve this. No, We’re not self victimizing?!? Wait, wait, they say we might be. Blackbirds don’t fly at night, do they? The tapping has stopped. The Pillars block out the STARS, and I hear no singing. NO SINGING. I’m doing it, rather we’re doing it again, aren’t we? I’m tasting blood, DAMN. When was the last time I brushed my teeth? When did we last sleep? WHICH ONE OF YOU FINISHED THE SPEED? WOW! we’re way up high, need to get back in . need to get back in before we fall a, a, sleee</p>
